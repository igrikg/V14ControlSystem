Question
Welcome to the second coding exercise.

Within ISIS, software development often takes the form of converting complex scientific ideas into software algorithms
 which transform scientific data. For example, applying a filter to an image to remove noise and other artefacts,
  treating data to correct for instrument calibration effects and even fitting models to a dataset in order to extract
   answers about a sample.

   For this test, we will ask you to work through a toy example so we can get an idea of your style and approach to
    developing user-oriented code.

Using C++/C or Python, implement a solution which uses the Brown-Conrady model for distortion to correct for barrel
 (positive radial) distortion in an input image. Although not required, a test-driven approach to development would be
  highly favoured. Please see the resources located in the following Dropbox folder which shows the simplified
   Brown-Conrady equation and images which show an example of what a distorted and corrected image look like.

For the purpose of this exercise you are not required to write a file loader/saver to load/save image data. You only
need to demonstrate how to implement an algorithm which will apply the Brown-Conrady correction.
 As a hint, your first step may be to create a sensible interface which represents inputs, outputs and
  action of your algorithm.
